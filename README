OurNet-FuzzyIndex-Multifields
=============================

DESCRIPTION

       OurNet::FuzzyIndex::Multifields adds extended features to OurNet::FuzzyIn-
       dex by indexing multifield documents. The basic usage is much like that of
       OurNet::FuzzyIndex. Please refer to it.

       A simple linear combination of multifields' scores is used as the scoring
       function of query result.
